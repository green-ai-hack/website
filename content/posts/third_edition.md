# 3rd edition @ CentraleSupélec

The **third edition** of the Green AI Hack took place at [CentraleSupélec](https://centralesupelec.fr/) in November 2024. **More than 20 students** from the MSc AI participated and solved a classic NLP task: sentiment analysis on movie reviews from IMDb.

Many solutions were explored from **traditional ML algorithms** to **deep learning models** and **transformers**. The best team managed to score a good accuracy score as well as minimizing environmental impacts by combining different algorithms.

Over the **two-day hackathon**, teams submitted a total of 160 solutions. The combined **carbon footprint** of these submissions was arround **20 gCO2eq** which account for less than ~20 min of video streaming ([impactco2.fr](https://impactco2.fr)).

Below is a graph showing the top submissions, illustrating the **trade-off between accuracy and environmental impact**:
